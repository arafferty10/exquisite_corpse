            Deep, deep in the woods they walked. The sun fell hours ago and a chill had crept into the air. There was a breeze slipping through the branches but a heavy silence seemed to weigh on the forest, muffling any rustling leaves. The entire place seemed eerily quiet, even footsteps on dry leaves made only the slightest whisper. As the night grew darker, free from moonlight,  the forest below the canopy fell into complete darkness. They decided it would be best to make camp for the night so that they would be settled for when the fog arrived.

            The cool air whistled through the trees and ominously drew the mist closer with each passing minute. The tent was pitched, fire made, food cooking, and weapons at the ready. They were prepared, nothing would take any of them tonight. With empty stomachs and parched throats, they quickly downed each of their meger portions and huddled around the flickering flame for warmth. The fog crept closer and closer... They could feel its cool touch reaching out for them, soon they would be engulffed, and there was nothing anyone could do about it...

            One of them had the bright idea to bring out a giant bottle of Southern Comfort. They drank and drank until the bottle was empty. It brought some warmth back into the cool cool night. The group almost forgot they were lost. They sang and danced around the fire, loud enough for <span class="creature">the creature</span>  to hear them. It crept at the edge of the fog watching them, waiting for its moment. Soon it would get what it had been craving all day as it had, unbeknownst to them, encouraged them deeper into its forest. It had been a long time since <span class="creature"> the creature</span> had been able to play. It was excited, but patient. It could wait a few more hours to satisfy its needs. The group one by one stumbled back to their tent ready for a deep sleep as the fog finally engulfed them.

            Upon their awakening, all seemed to be as it should be. The sun had risen, the fog had come and gone and the dew had fallen. Glistening green blades of grass stood laden with droplets of dew from the passing of the night. In the ring of stones, the once warm fire lay cold and black. The fire had gone out hours ago; however, beneath the damp surface ash there were still a few small coals alive. Coals to breathe life into a new fire for the day. A fire to cook breakfast for the group. A group with one less mouth to feed each day.
