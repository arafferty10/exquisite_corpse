        <p>Deep, deep in the woods they walked. The sun fell hours ago and a chill had crept into the air. There was a breeze slipping through the branches but a heavy silence seemed to weigh on the forest, muffling any rustling leaves. The entire place seemed muffled, even footsteps on dry leaves made only the slightest whisper. As the night grew darker, free of moonlight, all beneath the canopy fell into complete darkness. They decided it would be best to make camp for the night so that they would be settled for when the fog arrived. </p>
