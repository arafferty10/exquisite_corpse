            Deep, deep in the woods they walked. The sun fell hours ago and a chill had crept into the air. There was a breeze slipping through the branches but a heavy silence seemed to weigh on the forest, muffling any rustling leaves. The entire place seemed muffled, even footsteps on dry leaves made only the slightest whisper. As the night grew darker, free of moonlight, all beneath the canopy fell into complete darkness. They decided it would be best to make camp for the night so that they would be settled for when the fog arrived.

            The cool air whistled through the trees and ominously drew the mist closer with each passing minute. The tent was pitched, fire made, food cooking, and weapons at the ready. They were ready, nothing would take any of them tonight. With empty stomachs and parched throats, they quickly downed each of their meger portions and huddled around the flickering flame for warmth. The fog crept closer and closer... They could feel its cool touch reaching out for them, soon they would be engulffed, and there was nothing anyone could do about it...
