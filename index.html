            Deep, deep in the woods they walked. The sun fell hours ago and a chill had crept into the air. There was a breeze slipping through the branches but a heavy silence seemed to weigh on the forest, muffling any rustling leaves. The entire place seemed eerily quiet, even footsteps on dry leaves made only the slightest whisper. As the night grew darker, free from moonlight,  the forest below the canopy fell into complete darkness. They decided it would be best to make camp for the night so that they would be settled for when the fog arrived.

            The cool air whistled through the trees and ominously drew the mist closer with each passing minute. The tent was pitched, fire made, food cooking, and weapons at the ready. They were prepared, nothing would take any of them tonight. With empty stomachs and parched throats, they quickly downed each of their meger portions and huddled around the flickering flame for warmth. The fog crept closer and closer... They could feel its cool touch reaching out for them, soon they would be engulffed, and there was nothing anyone could do about it...

            One of them had the bright idea to bring out a giant bottle of Southern Comfort. They drank and drank until the bottle was empty. It brought some warmth back into the cool cool night. The group almost forgot they were lost. They sang and danced around the fire, loud enough for <span class="creature"><strong>the creature</strong></span>  to hear them. It crept at the edge of the fog watching them, waiting for its moment. Soon it would get what it had been craving all day as it had, unbeknownst to them, encouraged them deeper into its forest. It had been a long time since <span class="creature"><strong> the creature</strong></span> had been able to play. It was excited, but patient. It could wait a few more hours to satisfy its needs. The group one by one stumbled back to their tent ready for a deep sleep as the fog finally engulfed them.

            Its cool touch wrapped itself around and between each of the tents. The crackling fire dwindled under the dense moisture that now threatened any sense of visibility the wanderers may have had that dark and quiet night. Its presence brought with it a sense of uneasiness. The chills racing down the spines of each petrified person was impossible to ignore. The fear was palpable... a distant shriek echoed across the valley. The intensity of the omnipresent sound grew louder and louder almost as if it was approaching a climatic earth shattering crescendo growing and growing and then...nothing...

            Upon their awakening, all seemed to be as it should be. The sun had risen, the fog had come and gone and the dew had fallen. Glistening green blades of grass stood laden with droplets of dew from the passing of the night. In the ring of stones, the once warm fire lay cold and black. The fire had gone out hours ago; however, beneath the damp surface ash there were still a few small coals alive. Coals to breathe life into a new fire for the day. A fire to cook breakfast for the group. A group with one less mouth to feed each day.

            The group felt an overwhelming sense of peace within themselves. They were lost, and should have been worried about food or how they were going to find their way out of the forest, but instead were happy and at peace. Everyone seemed to suddenly forget that they were lost in the woods, and wanted to keep going deeper and deeper and deeper rather than trying to get out. They all felt a comforting presence that they couldn't describe - a presence inviting them to stay in this deep, dark and lonely place. <span class="creature"><strong>the creature</strong></span> was pleased with how easy this group was to put under his mesmerizing spell. </p>

            They quickly and quietly packed up their camp and prepared to set off for the day. They ventured deeper into the woods in search of something no one quite understood what it was though. All they knew is that they would know what it was when they found it. As they hiked one of them pointed out that they could of sworn that there had been one more person the night before. They argued about it together, but no one could agree if they had been four or three in the group. They decided to leave it be for it didn't matter. All they cared about now was finding the thing they were in search of. <span class="creature"><strong>the creature</strong></span> was pleased. He had managed to make a new friend last night and soon more from this group would join in on the fun. Until now he was simply pleased to know that no one was panicing about one of their own going missing.</p>

             The absence of panic within the group went eerily unnoticed, but they continued to march on, deeper still into the dense forest. The rhythm of their steps as they fell in harmony pressed them on. The rhythm drove them so fiercely that not a single one of them questioned their lack of breakfast that morning. Or the fact that the last time they set camp was actually the night before last. In fact, quite a lot had gone unnoticed by the group. For starters, their boots had been left behind days ago and their feet were raw from the miles and frostbitten from the chill. Their rations had run out days before without notice, too. And if either of them were to have looked back at any point in the last day. Neither of them did look back; however, they only continued their march.

             Like clockwork, they drudged on through the untamed wilderness. The cold clutched onto any exposed skin that wasn't properly covered. The fog began to collect itself at the crest of the same ridge as it always had, their fate was still uncertain. Hunger and thirst were the only tangible feelings either of them could fully recognize. With rations gone, no fresh water to be found, and a landscape seemingly bare of edible food, the intense reality of this situation was beginning to set in fast and with that came questions. How did I get here? Where am I? Who is this? Who am I... The fog had inched closer than expected, its chill licked at their bare ankles, threatening to crawl all the way up their bodies. There was not going to be anywhere to hide this time.

            An indistict yell was suddenly heard from the distance. This startling and exectpected sound caused the group to finally snap out of their confused state. They heard the yell again, and looked at one another. All at once they realized they recognized the voice - it belonged to the missing camper that they somehow had completely forgotten about. They also became aware of how cold they were, how much pain they were in, and the fact that they were obviously in danger. The yell called out once again. The campers panicked. Their friend was in trouble, they were in trouble, and they had no clue how to solve any of their problems. They began frantically running in the direction of the sound.

            <span class="creature"><strong>The Creature</strong></span> wasn't pleased. Actually, he was angry. He had gotten so far with these campers, how could things have possibly gone wrong? No one had ever managed to break out of his mesmerizing spell. He had never planned for how to deal with this, and he had to act fast. He knew if the campers followed their friend's yells,they would be led to the creature's home. The creature could try and fight all of the campers, but 3 against 1 would be taking a risk - he was weak because it had been so long since he had been able to feast on a human. He regretted waiting to feast on the first camper, but now he had to think fast. The campers would be at his den soon, and the creature needed to find a way to get the upper hand against them.</p>

              The fog became thicker as they ran towards the screams of their lost friend. The remaining members of the group couldn't see in front of their own noses. They had to hold hands just to avoid loosing each other. There had been a brief moment when they had thought they had lost the person in the back, but it only lasted a few seconds. They had reached a cave where the screams had been coming from. They hesitated for a moment before the ventured into its welcoming void.<span class="creature"><strong>The Creature</strong></span> was pleased. He had successfully managed to convince one of his new friends to abandon the group despite the set back. He had wondered off a cliff thanks to the fog and he would go back to find this fallen friend after he had dealt the remaining members of this group.<span class="creature"><strong>The Creature</strong></span> had siezed the opportunity to take the fallen member's place among his friends and no one had noticed thanks to his fog.</p>

            <p class="story fade cave">
              <!-- Ashley Koett-->
              The campers started venturing deep into the black cave, only half aware of what brought them there in the first place but reminded every time they heard their friend yell. They were back under <span class="creature"><strong>The Creature's</strong></span> spell, and were barely able to think for themselves. They creeped through the dark cave, paralyzed with fear but determined to keep going. Deep into the cave, they found their friend tied to a post. They all immidiately got to work at untying their friend, and focused all their attention on this task. Finally, everyone was distracted and it was the perfect time for <span class="creature"><strong>The Creature</strong></span> to strike. <span class="creature"><strong>The Creature</strong></span> crept out of the darkness towards the remaining campers</p>
